Bridget is a _minimal_ Hugo theme designed for photographers / visual artists.

The inspiration for this theme came from a video by <u>[Hyperlexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed)</u>, which can be found <u>[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt3A2lNN2aE)</u>. Initially, it was designed using pure TypeScript and CSS. However, after website designer <u>[Tyler McRobert](https://tylermcrobert.com)</u> made the source code publicly available, the whole project was modified to mimic the original design. The animations in Bridget are achieved using gsap and swiper. In essence, it is more like a porting of the original design into Hugo.

Once again, great shout out to <u>[Tyler McRobert](https://tylermcrobert.com)</u> for his inspiration to this project.
